<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am...</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am currently a senior at The University of Pittsburgh majoring in Communitcations with the goal of getting certificates in Digital Media and Public and Professional Writing.  This semester I am focused on finishing up my certifications, as I have already finished my gen-eds and classes for my major.  My current schedule is Writing For The Public on Mondays and Wednesdays and Composing Digital Media and Integrating Writing and Design on Tuesdays and Thursdays with two online classes including Corporate Storytelling and Visual Literacy.  This is much different than the Biology major I originally had chosen, however I think that the changed of major was for the better as I realized early on that I did not have the passion to go into a science field.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a designer, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>Although I may not have the technical experience when it comes to coding or using certain software, I have a plethora of other skills that will hopefully allow me to excel in this class.  I have taken a good amount of writing courses in my prior three years at Pitt which has given me the skill to write at a higher level than I previously did.  I also like to think that I am a pretty creative, so having this class teach me the basics of how to implement my ideas onto the web would be a big help for my future plans.  I love seeing how web pages make themselves look appealing to an audience while also having a simple interface to navigate.  If I could takeaway one thing from this class that is what i would be most interested in learning, the way to make a website not only look appealing but also be appealing to use.</h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>In my opinion the main use of a website is to not only distribute information to an audience but also to be visually appealing so that more people chose to use your website over other of lesser quality.  For instance a user-interface that is simple,straightforward, and easy-to-use will see more net-traffic than others that may be harder to use due to the simple interface being more user-friendly for beginners.  Visual aids such as a nice color scheme or layot can also set the tone for a website depending on the colors or layout chosen.  For instance, Nike choses to use more black and white minimalistic apporaches along with photos of their latest ad campaigns for their website and has all items on their site categorized in an easy to find way including a search bar to help.  A wbesite like this (not necessarily Nike) will almost always see more traffic than a website that looks like Craigslist.  Met with a map and a bunch of bright blue wording on a blank white screen, this website looks like it hasnt been updated since it was created which in turn makes the site look less user-friendly and harder to use. </h3>

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>After I graduate from Pitt I plan on getting a part-time job.  Honeslty speaking I would take any job that will work with my schedule since I will be aiming to get my masters at PennWest University.  I plan to do whatever job I can do that will allow me to also take classes for my masters without being too overworked.  After I get my masters, I plan to get some sort of job in the world of public relations with my gol being to create my own PR firm.  Having the experience from this class in creating media on the web will most definitely help me in this endeavor as I will liekly need my own website to make this possible.  Having the knowledge of how to do this before the time comes when I am ready to make this happen will be a major help in getting me a step closer to my goal.  This class can help me make sure when it is time to make my own website for this I will already have an idea of how to do this and what works and what does not.</h3>
